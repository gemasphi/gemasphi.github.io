      <description>DISCLAIMER: If you&amp;rsquo;re a potential future employer, this story didn&amp;rsquo;t happen - it&amp;rsquo;s a bald-faced lie, a figment of my imagination. In fact, this story wasn&amp;rsquo;t even written by a human; it was generated by GPT-3.
 This story is a retelling of something that happened to me two years ago. Autobiographical in nature, I make no claims to the veracity nor the journalistic integrity of what you are about to read.</description>

      <description>A blog by a raving lunatic.
Do not believe a word you see here; every fact is slighty wrong, every argument fallacious and every story a lie.</description>
