<li>Finished deep learning proposal, team lab, pudong and going to hongcun being scammed by the hostel, getting a taxi into the middle of hongcunzhen, a guard caught us and we bought a ticket to get rid of him, we sneaked into an abandoned house and camped there.</li>
<li>After waking up in the middle of the abandoned house we camped in and waking up in panic thinking somebody was coming, we packed our stuff and headed back to hongcun. It was packed of Chinese tourists after suffering with them for some time while we went around the village, we decided to go to Huangshan. It took sometime to get there due to the traffic, along the road we saw a massive bamboo forest and some tiny villages. We lunched and started walking to the mountain. We took a cable car with ominous views of the mountain. When we got to the top, there we saw it multiple peaks with trees that had flat branches, something out of a chinese painting. We walked around the mountain, trying to find a place to camp. We went to bed early to watch the sunrise, after a cozy dinner</li>
<li>Woke up at 5 am in the tent surrounded by who wanted to see the sunrise. After a while the security came and told us that it was a public space and we should leave. We closed the tent and enjoyed the sunrise for a while. We ate breakfast and cracked open a cold one. While we were eating, a random old Chinese guy took us pictures, we asked for his wechat. Afterwards, we climbed down, so many steps for around 5 hours, greeting random people we found along the way. We got to the train in time and went to Wuhan while watching avatar.  We place we slept was a shady shit hotel in a residential area full of mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Woke up and started working on NLP. Then went to a coffee shop, worked for a bit, then went to to visit the yellow crane pagoda, back to work and finished deep learning. We got the train station and the train was late by two hours.</li>
<li>Finally a good night of sleep in a train.  We arrived at zhangjiajie. We decided to grab a bus to furongzhen where we had a total of 50 minutes in the town, then we had to go back again. While on those bus rides, we picked our NLP project proposal.</li>
<li>Rainy day in zhangjiajie. When we got there, we couldn&rsquo;t see most of the peaks. So we decided to go back and work on NLP.</li>
<li>Another rainy day in Zhangjiajie. We worked in the morning, then went for a walk in the afternoon where Joao fell on his head and started bleeding. We stayed, while he went back. Afterwards, stayed up late trying to get NLP to work.</li>
<li>Woke up really early after going to bed really late. Finally, zhangjiajie but with a clear sky, we went from platform to platform and hiked down and went along a stream. We caught a bus to fenghuang. When we got there, I started working on NLP. We had to fake results, and walked around the river enjoying the music and the lights.</li>
<li>Woke at 5 am to see fenghuang. When we went to catch the bus to guilin there was only 4 left and we were 5. We decided to split 3-2. We went to a cat coffee and worked the whole afternoon. Afterwards we roamed the town looking for a place to eat. We found a place where we had a really cute interaction with one of the waitresses</li>
<li>Woke up late in fenghuang. We went to take the bus to guilin. In the bus there were only two other people and they were Portuguese, we talked a bit with them. The bus trip was pretty good, full of small hills and villages, and lone stilt houses. We asked the driver to drop us off between longsheng and heping, which he did in the middle of nowhere. A bus comes to take us along a bumpy road into Ping&rsquo;An, a zhuang minority village. The village was surrounded by rice fields full of water along the hills. We went to our hostel and afterwards watched the sunset overlooking the rice fields. In the night, we watched avatar</li>
<li>Woke up in the morning to see the rice villages and found some old books, some filled with propaganda. We walked to dazhai, going through two villages. Dazhai is a yao village where the women had long hair. When we were walking to there, we found a big ass snake. When we got to dazhai at night, there we found  people gathered in small campfire that won a prize from a supermarket chain. They invited us to eat and drink with them, we went. We took pictures for they brand. After, eating with them, we went on our way to the hostel, where the light was scarce and there were fireflies on the way, it started raining and we couldn&rsquo;t find it, we called the guy, he gave us a location but it was wrong. When we were coming back, the guys from the campfire started shooting fireworks. After searching for a long time to no avail, when we are almost quiting, some yao ladies asked us were we were going. We showed them the Chinese characters and they called the hostel lady. When we got there it was a yao house. The lady offered us water and we asked for tea and she offered it as well. After a long day going through rice fields, minority villages, bamboo filled paths, hearing things crawl through grass, being greeted by random people on our way, I lay on my bed, hearing frogs croak, writing this.</li>
<li>Woke up, took a bus to guilin and worked</li>
<li>On a train to Beijing, started reading Tibetan book of the dead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leading up to this trip was very interesting. Andre&rsquo;s family came to Beijing, so I decided to give them most of my clothes. All the clothes I left had to fit in a backpack. I didn&rsquo;t have to pay for the extra luggage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had several deadlines that would happen in the middle of the trip. I got rid of the first one as soon as I could what that meant was that I did an all nighter right before the train to Shanghai. I manage to start and finish my Big Data homework in one night. Then, packed my stuff and even went to buy a Tsinghua hoodie as I didn&rsquo;t have any winter clothes with me anymore. The train would depart early morning to Shanghai and then we had another train to Hangzhou. Funny enough, I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to sleep in the train, I must&rsquo;ve slept for 1-2 hours during the day. I worked on the Deep Learning homework most of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hangzhou</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When we got the train to Hangzhou, we had some random conversations with Chinese people in the train. Everyone was interested in what we had to say, not only the people in our table but around our table as well.</li>
<li>We got a bus and went straight to fake paris. It&rsquo;s what the name implies, even Google Photos recognizes the photos I have from there as actually being in Paris.</li>
<li>We got a bus back to the West Lake, saw a pagoda and then found out about a show that happened near the west lake. As, we didn&rsquo;t want to pay, we managed to find a way around the stage, and we could see the show from the side without having to pay.</li>
<li>I worked for a bit in a KFC and then we decided to go to sleep. As the west lake is mostly green on the map. We just wanted to find a random place where we could set tent and sleep there. It wasn&rsquo;t a task as easy as we thought it would be and we wandered about for a good time. I remember going through bamboo forests in the dark. We found a place, we thought was good enough since it seemed to be far away from the road.</li>
<li>We slept there, then it started to rain in the middle of the night. We didn&rsquo;t do anything about it and just tried to sleep, the tent started to get wet.  I remember shivering a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When we finally woke up, we found out that we were in a park and we could hear people walking around. We quickly packed our stuff, ate breakfast underneath a pavilion and left.</li>
<li>This day is and was one of my favorites. The day was mostly us carrying around our heavy backpack going in the direction of tea villages.  The daylio entry makes justice to it, I don&rsquo;t have anything else to add. The atmosphere of those misty tea fields and bamboo forests as we mostly walked alone through those paths that connected villages. The temples we went were deep in the middle of the forest and we were covered with moss.</li>
<li>When it started to get dark, and we finally decided to settle and camp nearby a tea village. We went to buy noodles from a shop and the owner got us warm water, so we could eat them.</li>
<li>We decided to camp in the middle of the tea fields that were in the mountains surrounding the village as the village was in a valley. We followed the path that we found that went behind some houses but then the path disappeared and there was no artificial light on the path to guide us, only the moon and light pollution from the village. We just savagely climbed between each &ldquo;trench&rdquo; of tea until we found a place that was plane and big enough for us to fit our tent, as soon as we did we camped there and cracked a cold one. It had been a good and strenuous day indeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li>After a &ldquo;good nights rest&rdquo;, we woke up early and went back to the village to get a bus. I dropped my phone when going down as I was taking a picture.</li>
<li>We finished exploring around the west lake itself. Afterwards, we decided to go to a coffee shop to get some work done. I got deep learning homework to work. I have a image of my dusty screen that showed the model converging that I sent to the Andre and Francisco.</li>
<li>Afterwards, we got a taxi and went to the train station, and arrived at Shanghai after not taking a shower for three days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shanghai</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When we arrived in Shanghai, we went to our AirBnB, took a shower and got ready to go out.</li>
<li>We pre-gamed so hard that I don&rsquo;t remember leaving the AirBnB. I only remember random moments of that night such as me saying &ldquo;take me home&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Next day I was completely destroyed. We went to the yuyu gardens where I remember getting so much to eat but my stomach was upset, so I basically wasted money. We later that night met with Francisco and his mom and went to a Michelin star restaurant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The next day, we went to check some nearby water towns but it was raining most of the time. We did a game of thrones bingo and went out again. This time we were a bit more responsible. When coming back, I fell asleep in the taxi and the taxi driver woke me up as we had arrived. In a hurry I left the taxi and started walking towards the AirBnB. Where then he shouted at me to come to him but I said &ldquo;fuck off&rdquo;. As we were getting back home, I realize I didn&rsquo;t have my glasses with me and that I had left them in the taxi. I call him back and tried with help of google translate to try and meet up somewhere and somehow it worked and I got my glasses back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 6 &amp; 7:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The next days were unremarkable besides the waste of money that team lab was.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anhui</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 7:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since the train was late we arrived in the middle of night, we  got &ldquo;scammed&rdquo; by the hostel, the place didn&rsquo;t exist, so we didn&rsquo;t have any place to sleep.  And to be honest, we had planned to trick the hostel as well, as the reservation was for 3 people who went to find the place but we were going to try to sneak two more in (me and francisco)</li>
<li>We weren&rsquo;t finding a decent place to sleep, so we decided to grab a DiDi to go  Hongcun and camp nearby the village. We split where 2 people stayed back trying to find a place to sleep in a hostel and 3 people when to the village.</li>
<li>We asked the DiDi driver to let us leave on the side and not inside the village. As he goes around the village and we leave the DiDi, a security guard approaches us in a bike.</li>
<li>He asks us for our ticket. We didn&rsquo;t have one, we didn&rsquo;t even plan on entering the village at night, since we couldn&rsquo;t camp in the middle of the village. So, how do we get rid of this guy? We couldn&rsquo;t say we were camping, since wild camping is technically illegal in China. We decide to buy the ticket, so the guy stops pestering us. We buy the ticket, but don&rsquo;t enter the village and leave.</li>
<li>Obviously, when we leave and don&rsquo;t enter, the guy gets suspicious. We find a way into the some fields and cross a bridge. We see his flashlight, nearby the of the path we went into and pointing around the field. We see him go back and forth along the main road with motorbike trying to find us. Meanwhile, we go forth along the path without any light, so he couldn&rsquo;t find us. We find an abandoned house, some sort of cottage.</li>
<li>We get paranoid if it&rsquo;s a good idea or not for us to go inside the house (the house was falling apart) and find a room to set camp. Meanwhile, we get a call from the other two saying that they didn&rsquo;t find a place and are coming. They are able to somehow sleep in the ticket office.</li>
<li>Eventually, after much back and forth, we decided to camp inside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 8:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;After waking up in the middle of the abandoned house we camped in and waking up in panic thinking somebody was coming, we packed our stuff and headed back to hongcun. It was packed of Chinese tourists after suffering with them for some time while we went around the village, we decided to go to Huangshan. It took sometime to get there due to the traffic, along the road we saw a massive bamboo forest and some tiny villages. We lunched and started walking to the mountain. We took a cable car with ominous views of the mountain. When we got to the top, there we saw it multiple peaks with trees that had flat branches, something out of a chinese painting. We walked around the mountain, trying to find a place to camp. We went to bed early to watch the sunrise, after a cozy dinner&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 9:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Woke up at 5 am in the tent surrounded by who wanted to see the sunrise. After a while the security came and told us that it was a public space and we should leave. We closed the tent and enjoyed the sunrise for a while. We ate breakfast and cracked open a cold one. While we were eating, a random old Chinese guy took us pictures, we asked for his wechat. Afterwards, we climbed down, so many steps for around 5 hours, greeting random people we found along the way. We got to the train in time and went to Wuhan while watching avatar.  We place we slept was a shady shit hotel in a residential area full of mosquitoes.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wuhan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 9:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I remember the DiDi ride from train station to our hostel for some reason fondly, the layout of the city with highways going through high residential  buildings with random rooms lit.</li>
<li>Both this room and the other room that was a failure we got through picking the cheapest option possible from a WeChat app. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy didn&rsquo;t want to accept foreigners as the place was in &ldquo;very bad conditions&rdquo;. Helena called her Chinese friends who managed to get convince the guy to let us in. The place was horrible, one of the worst I had ever had in a city. It was completely filled with mosquitoes, the water didn&rsquo;t heat, everything seemed to be falling apart, besides that, early in the morning, we woke up because of constructions next to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 10:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We started working on the NLP homework that morning in the lobby of that shitty hotel. Aftewards, we went to a coffeshop where most people in the group worked. Me, Andre and Helena went in the afternoon for a bit of touristing and then we started working again.</li>
<li>At night, we had a train to catch that was late by 2 hours and Helena went to Beijing to work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zhangjiajie</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 11:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The train was mostly empty, so we were able to have a good night&rsquo;s rest. We planned on getting a bus to Furongzhen and come back all in the same day. We somehow lost a tent. I remember trying to find a final project theme for NLP on the train and on the bus to Furongzhen.</li>
<li>When we got there, it was raining and we had a total of 2-3 hours to see the town before coming to the station to get the bus back. After lunch and figuring the travel logistics out, we must&rsquo;ve had a total of 50 minutes on that town.</li>
<li>When we got back, we had the room of the hostel completely for us. I remember being absolutely destroyed while Andre was trying to finish the NLP proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 12:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Rainy day in zhangjiajie. When we got there, we couldn&rsquo;t see most of the peaks. So we decided to go back and work on NLP.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 13:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Another rainy day in Zhangjiajie. We worked in the morning, then went for a walk in the afternoon where Joao fell on his head and started bleeding. We stayed, while he went back. Afterwards, stayed up late trying to get NLP to work.&rdquo;</li>
<li>We stayed up until 2-3 am, and as we didn&rsquo;t want to bother others, we went to the hostels lobby to work. We went to sleep defeated, it wasn&rsquo;t working.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 14:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We woke up at around 6am to have time to see Zhangjiajie. This time the sky was clear, thank god. We took a gamble as the weather was shit and we couldn&rsquo;t see the peaks properly. We decided to stay another day as we had seen in the weather forecast that it was going to clear up that day, besides that, it gave us more time to work on our homework.</li>
<li>It was worth it. We even dodged chinese tourists for a while. We went to check most of the platforms we had already seen the other days. Afterwards, we hiked down and went along a stream. I remember that the topic of conversation while we hiked along the stream was &ldquo;would you rathers&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We then caught a bus to Fenghuang.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fenghuang</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 14:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When we got there, we tried to finish the homework in the hostel, while the rest went for a walk around the town.</li>
<li>We submitted the HW at 10pm, we decided to fake results and just get it over with, and enjoy the town.</li>
<li>This day where we started with a clear sky in Zhangjiajie and ended in Fenghuang was one of the coolest days. I remember the stress of having to fake the results for NLP, after working and staying up late to try and fail to get them, and then the relief of cracking a cold one while we roamed around Fenghuang with the background music coming from bars and the riverside lights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 15:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We woke up at 5am to have time to see fenghuang. We had planned on getting a bus to the rice fields midday.</li>
<li>When we went to catch that bus, there were only 4 seats left.  We decided to split. João and Micael went to catch the bus, since they couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose more days. Me, André and Francisco stayed.</li>
<li>The rest of the day was mostly spent working on homework in a cat coffeshop near our hostel.</li>
<li>Later, we roamed the town looking for something to eat. We had a very cute interaction with one of the waitresses of the restaurant.</li>
<li>We went to our hostel and worked on homework again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guilin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 16:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Woke up late in fenghuang. We went to take the bus to guilin. In the bus there were only two other people and they were Portuguese, we talked a bit with them. The bus trip was pretty good, full of small hills and villages, and lone stilt houses. We asked the driver to drop us off between longsheng and heping, which he did in the middle of nowhere. A bus comes to take us along a bumpy road into Ping&rsquo;An, a zhuang minority village. The village was surrounded by rice fields full of water along the hills. We went to our hostel and afterwards watched the sunset overlooking the rice fields. In the night, we watched avatar&rdquo;</li>
<li>I was hoping we wouldn&rsquo;t pay the ticket when got that bus in the middle of nowhere (we did).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 17:</strong>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Woke up in the morning to see the rice villages and found some old books, some filled with propaganda. We walked to dazhai, going through two villages. Dazhai is a yao village where the women had long hair. When we were walking to there, we found a big ass snake. When we got to dazhai at night, there we found  people gathered in small campfire that won a prize from a supermarket chain. They invited us to eat and drink with them, we went. We took pictures for they brand. After, eating with them, we went on our way to the hostel, where the light was scarce and there were fireflies on the way, it started raining and we couldn&rsquo;t find it, we called the guy, he gave us a location but it was wrong. When we were coming back, the guys from the campfire started shooting fireworks. After searching for a long time to no avail, when we are almost quiting, some yao ladies asked us were we were going. We showed them the Chinese characters and they called the hostel lady. When we got there it was a yao house. The lady offered us water and we asked for tea and she offered it as well. After a long day going through rice fields, minority villages, bamboo filled paths, hearing things crawl through grass, being greeted by random people on our way, I lay on my bed, hearing frogs croak, writing this.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Day 18:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We woke up and took a bus to guilin. When we got there, we went straight to a coffeshop to work.</li>
<li>Funny that guilin city, one of the most famous places in China, the only thing I visited was the train station and the coffee shop next to it.</li>
<li>One thing I remember vividly was us sitting on the floor of the train station with our laptops connected to the a phone charging station, working on homework. The deadline was that night.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A long ride until Beijing. We watched some avatar and I started reading the Tibetan book of the dead.</p>
</li>
